## info

Simple system tray icon to display a list of hosts dynamically pulled from your local SSH config file

Clicking on a host opens a Windows Terminal SSH connection to the host. If you need multiple connections to the same host, just keep clicking :)

## requirements

- Windows Terminal must be installed in the default location
I.E. `wt.exe` must be in the `Microsoft\WindowsApps\` subfolder off your user's local application path. For example: `C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe`
